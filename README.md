# League Kit

League of Legends integration.

This is basically a clone of [league-connect][leagueConnect] with tiny modifications and with the use of the lockfile
method used by [lcu-connector][lcuConnector] to detect the client instead of the process method.

Intended mainly for personal use with other applications and not usable in the current state.
